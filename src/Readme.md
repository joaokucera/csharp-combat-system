## Some general FAQ

### Why this assignment?
The test resembles a super simplified combat system, the actual work you might be participating in if you would join the team.  
It's a great opportunity to determine whether you like the type of work and it's a relevant and concrete task. Not just a random technical test. 

### Time investment: 
We believe 6-10 hours is realistic, but you determine the time investment, as long as it matches the spec deliverables. 

### Time-frame: 
Ideally, we'd like the assignment to be completed within four and nine days. It is not a hard deadline, but we want to keep the momentum.

### Assignment & deliverables:
Create a working early combat prototype with the following specs: 
- Units have the described **Stats**
- Units have the described **Abilities**
- Abilities can be **applied** to Units
- You've implemented **turnorder**
- You've implemented **ability&targetSelector**
- We're a big fan of code that is readable, maintainable and extensible. Curious about your style.
